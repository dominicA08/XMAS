                        <h1>Confession Book</h1>
                        <p>Merry Christmas.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="page back">
                        <p>It started back in the finals of our first year, first semester. It was early in the morning when I rode a jeep, not knowing I was about to meet someone who would later become a major plot twist in my December 2025. I know you probably don’t remember this anymore, but that was the first time I met you. I was completely speechless because of your beauty. My eyes lit up, and I couldn’t even focus on my reviewer because I was so distracted by you. Every time I had the chance, I would steal a glance toward your side of the jeep, where you were sitting.</p>
                    </div>
                </div>
                <div class="leaf" data-index="1">
                    <div class="page front">
                        <p>I honestly thought I would never see you again. But on the same day, that same morning, as I was climbing the stairs going to our test room in the C Building, I saw you again. This time, you glanced at me. The moment our eyes met, my heart fluttered. You were unbelievably beautiful. After that, I immediately told everything to my friends. When I got home that day, I wasn’t thinking about our exams anymore. I was thinking about you. Even at work, I couldn’t stop replaying what happened, meeting you on the jeep and then again on the stairs.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="page back">
                        <p>Day by day, I kept praying that I would see you again, that maybe we’d walk to school together, or even go home at the same time. I even searched and stalked the entire AISAT page, hoping I’d see someone who looked like you among the reactors of their posts. Every time the Phoenix page, the AISAT page, or even our school group pages posted something, I would check the reactions just to see if I could find you. I did this over and over, but I always failed.</p>
                    </div>
                </div>
                <div class="leaf" data-index="2">
                    <div class="page front">
                        <p>Then second semester came, and it turned out to be one of the most beautiful things that happened. We had a schedule, I don’t remember if it was Friday or Saturday, where our rooms were beside each other on the 5th floor of the F Building. Rooms 501, 502, 503. The MA, MB, and MC sections were all next to each other. That’s when I found out we were in the same department, Computer Science, and both first-year students. I was always excited to come to school on that schedule. Even though it was on the 5th floor, all my exhaustion disappeared the moment I saw you.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="page back">
                        <p>I know you probably don’t remember this, but sometimes we made eye contact. I don’t think you gave much meaning to those moments, but they meant something to me. When I found out you were in MC, something clicked in my mind. I heard from Ate Jodi, a Computer Science officer, that students could be transferred to another section if slots ran out. At that time, my friend JC and I still had a big balance, so I stayed calm and started planning to transfer to BC3MC, where you were. I was hesitant because I thought, what if I transferred and you weren’t there anymore? It would be a waste. But I still took the risk. I kept praying that you wouldn’t change your course or your section.</p>
                    </div>
                </div>
                <div class="leaf" data-index="3">
                    <div class="page front">
                        <p>Then enrollment day came, the last day for late enrollees. We were told that BC3MB was already full. Our friend group, four of us, decided we should move to another section together. They suggested BC3MA, but I disagreed and strongly encouraged them to choose BC3MC. And that’s where we ended up.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="page back">
                        <p>During the week of online classes, I didn’t think much of it. I thought maybe you weren’t in MC after all. But I noticed a girl who looked like you. I stared at her picture for a long time before finally deciding to check the members of our advisory group chat. Then I saw your name. It was you, the same girl I met back in my first year. I was completely stunned. That moment felt unbelievably lucky.</p>
                    </div>
                </div>
                <div class="leaf" data-index="4">
                    <div class="page front">
                        <p>When face-to-face classes finally happened, the girl I had been dreaming about was suddenly in the same class as me. At first, I thought you were already taken, and seeing you close to someone else honestly hurt. I didn’t know the truth then, so I stayed quiet. Even after I heard you were single, my feelings never faded. Not even once. I chose to admire you from a safe distance. Seeing you across the classroom was already enough to make me happy. I’d steal glances, use my peripheral vision just to look at you without being obvious. Even the smallest moments, like catching you glance in my direction, made my heart feel full.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="page back">
                        <p>As time passed, my feelings for you grew deeper. I added you online, added your friends too so it wouldn’t be obvious. I posted little hints through songs, not knowing if you noticed or if I was just assuming. Eventually, I gathered enough courage to message you first. From there, things continued. Day by day, I got to know you more, and day by day, I found myself falling for you even deeper.</p>
                    </div>
                </div>
                <div class="leaf" data-index="5">
                    <div class="page front">
                        <p>So this message serves as my confession for everything. I don’t expect you to feel the same way, and I’m not asking for anything in return. I’m not rushing you, and I’m not trying to push you into something you’re not ready for. What we have right now, the conversations, the moments, the connection we’re slowly building, I genuinely cherish that. I’m content with where we are, and I’m willing to let it grow naturally, one day at a time.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="page back">
                        <p>I simply wanted to be honest and let you know that my feelings are real and sincere. I’m genuinely interested in you, not just in the idea of you, but in who you are as a person. I’m not here to play games or make assumptions. I’m here because I value you, and I believe that what we have is something worth nurturing, without pressure and without expectations.</p>
                    </div>
                </div>
                <div class="leaf" data-index="6">
                    <div class="page front">
                        <p>I’m not asking you to be ready for a relationship. I’m just showing you that I’m patient, consistent, and serious in my intentions. I want to give you the space to move at your own pace, and all I hope is that, over time, you’ll see that my effort is genuine and that I’m someone who truly respects and cares for you. Whether this grows into something more or simply stays as it is for now, I’m grateful for you, and I wanted you to know how much you genuinely mean to me.</p>
